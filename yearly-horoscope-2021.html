    <h1>Horoscope 2021 (The main goal is self-improvement, motivation, and positive astrology)</h1>

    <p>Hello good people, welcome to Vedic nakshatra wisdom -the arena of positive astrology.

      The major transit that is happening in 2021 is the transit of Jupiter. Jupiter transits to Kumbha on April 05, 2021, retrogrades to Makara on Sep 14, 2021, and then direct back again to Kumbha on Nov 20, 2021. Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu will not change Rashi's in 2021 and will remain on Capricorn, Scorpio, and Taurus respectively.</p>

    <p> For fast-moving planets, the Sun stays in each sign for approximately 30 days. The Moon changes signs every 2 Â½ days, Mercury can be in a sign for 15- 60 days. Venus stays in a sign from 23 days to 2 months depending on the sign, Mars changes signs about every 2 months. </p>

    <p>So impacts of slow-moving planets will be considered for 2021 horoscope prediction unless a small planet plays a major role. Ashtakavarga point plays a significant role in the result of planet transit on each sign, so the higher the ashtakavarga point better the planet's results will be, you can get your ashtakavarga points for free online.</p>

    <p>This horoscope is based on the Ascendant sign.</p>


    <h2>Aries</h2>

    <p>For Aries people, Jupiter will be on your tenth house for half of the year and will be on your eleventh house for the rest of the year. Saturn will be on your tenth house for the entire year, Rahu will be on 2nd and Ketu will be on your 8th house.</p>

   <p> This year the major concentration of your life would be on social status, comfort, finance, career, savings, and transformation.</p>

   <p>Since Saturn which represents hard work dedication, reality, common people, etc resides on your tenth house with the guru the planet of wisdom for the first half, your chances of getting recognition increase if you had worked hard for your goals, since Saturn is willing to give you the positive result if you have dedication, persistence, and willingness to work hard to achieve what you desire. Letting down your ego and working with every kind of person with equality is your key to achieve your desire this year. Since planet Jupiter will be moving to your 11th house in late November your hard work and dedication have higher chances to fruity after November.<p>

   <p> With Rahu on 2nd house you might be tempted on spending some of your saved money on luxuries, but remember to spend with caution, since Ketu is looking at your Rahu and waiting to see when your Rahu kicks in and you spend that hard money for something not so important, and Ketu can transform you, and make realize the importance of that saving. So be careful about your spending, and spend cautiously, and spending only what is necessary for benefit of the whole family. Ketu might give you some interest in things that are not of material nature, so meditation seems to be a good option for you to start this year if you have not done so. Trust me, the solution to every problem is within you and you will definitely realize that after some good practice of meditation, it will just be another cliched statement.</p>

   <p> On the contrary, Rahu can give you some foreign wealth, if you have some investment outside of your country, or are working for a foreign company. Rahu invokes foreign-related stuff, so if you working with foreign people or have invested in foreign money, there is a chance of a gain.</p>

    <h2> Taurus</h2>

   <p>For Taurus people, Jupiter will be on your 9th house for half of the year and will be on your tenth house for the rest of the year. Saturn will be on your 9th house for the entire year, Rahu will be on your 1st house and Ketu will be on your 7th house.</p>

   <p> This year the major concentration of your life would be on your health, marriage, partnership, foreign travel, and higher education.</p>

   <p> Since the illusionary planet resides on your first house but in good dignity, Taurus people might be keen on having bodily pleasure in many ways possible, Taurus people would love to have a good time and spend some money on themselves, and might also get too focused on yourself, ignoring the fact that there is a partner waiting for your care, and nurture. Interest in newer inventions, software, photography, videography can occupy your time, you would be keen on traveling this year and fulfill your desire to travel, especially to foreign countries. I personally believe life is about the right balance between all components of life if you look at the universe its perfectly balanced, even a single inch of misalignment of earth could create a disaster, but it is in perfect balance with all the other planetary bodies, we are getting everything in a perfect combination to sustain life here in this planet earth, and we are made of this earth, so to flourish on this planet we need balance. Therefore getting too much involved with oneself in terms of material way can detach Taurus people from their partner, so some quality time with a partner would definitely help prosper the
    relationship, dividing time for oneself and for the loved one would be ideal to keep you happy. Meditating together with the partner, or being involved spiritually with the partner is the key to a successful relationship this year.</p>

   <p> This year is an excellent time for Taurus people to focus deep inside and improve since universe is there for your if you focus on expanding your knowledge and skills, this is the year to improve yourself, learn new skills, get ready be prepare for the future, polish yourself so that you can be a shining gold in the coming year, and your hard work and dedication will definitely be fulfilled. One key thing is patience, since Saturn is sitting on your position of luck, you might feel like you are not getting what you deserve but remember Saturn is all about patience, hard work, and not losing hope at any point in time, Saturn is your strict teacher and loves to throw a lot of tests in life but the main goal of the universe if to polish and shine you so that you get out of the karmic cycle and live eternally with blissfulness. There might be a chance of moving to a foreign land for higher studies, people with IT background can do well this year in terms of studies.</p>
