    <h1>Horoscope 2021 (The main goal is self-improvement, motivation, and positive astrology)</h1>

    <p>Hello good people, welcome to Vedic nakshatra wisdom -the arena of positive astrology.

      The major transit that is happening in 2021 is the transit of Jupiter. Jupiter transits to Kumbha on April 05, 2021, retrogrades to Makara on Sep 14, 2021, and then direct back again to Kumbha on Nov 20, 2021. Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu will not change Rashi's in 2021 and will remain on Capricorn, Scorpio, and Taurus respectively.</p>

    <p> For fast-moving planets, the Sun stays in each sign for approximately 30 days. The Moon changes signs every 2 Â½ days, Mercury can be in a sign for 15- 60 days. Venus stays in a sign from 23 days to 2 months depending on the sign, Mars changes signs about every 2 months. </p>

    <p>So impacts of slow-moving planets will be considered for 2021 horoscope prediction unless a small planet plays a major role. Ashtakavarga point plays a significant role in the result of planet transit on each sign, so the higher the ashtakavarga point better the planet's results will be, you can get your ashtakavarga points for free online.</p>

    <p>This horoscope is based on the Ascendant sign.</p>


    <h2>Aries Horoscope 2021</h2>

    <p>For Aries people, Jupiter will be on your tenth house for half of the year and will be on your eleventh house for the rest of the year. Saturn will be on your tenth house for the entire year, Rahu will be on 2nd and Ketu will be on your 8th house.</p>

    <p> This year the major concentration of your life would be on social status, comfort, finance, career, savings, and transformation.</p>

    <p>Since Saturn which represents hard work dedication, reality, common people, etc resides on your tenth house with the guru the planet of wisdom for the first half, your chances of getting recognition increase if you had worked hard for your goals, since Saturn is willing to give you the positive result if you have dedication, persistence, and willingness to work hard to achieve what you desire. Letting down your ego and working with every kind of person with equality is your key to achieve your desire this year. Since planet Jupiter will be moving to your 11th house in late November your hard work and dedication have higher chances to fruity after November.<p>

        <p> With Rahu on 2nd house you might be tempted on spending some of your saved money on luxuries, but remember to spend with caution, since Ketu is looking at your Rahu and waiting to see when your Rahu kicks in and you spend that hard money for something not so important, and Ketu can transform you, and make realize the importance of that saving. So be careful about your spending, and spend cautiously, and spending only what is necessary for benefit of the whole family. Ketu might give you some interest in things that are not of material nature, so meditation seems to be a good option for you to start this year if you have not done so. Trust me, the solution to every problem is within you and you will definitely realize that after some good practice of meditation, it will just be another cliched statement.</p>

        <p> On the contrary, Rahu can give you some foreign wealth, if you have some investment outside of your country, or are working for a foreign company. Rahu invokes foreign-related stuff, so if you working with foreign people or have invested in foreign money, there is a chance of a gain.</p>

        <h2> Taurus Horoscope 2021</h2>

        <p>For Taurus people, Jupiter will be on your 9th house for half of the year and will be on your tenth house for the rest of the year. Saturn will be on your 9th house for the entire year, Rahu will be on your 1st house and Ketu will be on your 7th house.</p>

        <p> This year the major concentration of your life would be on your health, marriage, partnership, foreign travel, and higher education.</p>

        <p> Since the illusionary planet resides on your first house but in good dignity, Taurus people might be keen on having bodily pleasure in many ways possible, Taurus people would love to have a good time and spend some money on themselves, and might also get too focused on yourself, ignoring the fact that there is a partner waiting for your care, and nurture. Interest in newer inventions, software, photography, videography can occupy your time, you would be keen on traveling this year and fulfill your desire to travel, especially to foreign countries. I personally believe life is about the right balance between all components of life if you look at the universe its perfectly balanced, even a single inch of misalignment of earth could create a disaster, but it is in perfect balance with all the other planetary bodies, we are getting everything in a perfect combination to sustain life here in this planet earth, and we are made of this earth, so to flourish on this planet we need balance. Therefore getting too much involved with oneself in terms of material way can detach Taurus people from their partner, so some quality time with a partner would definitely help prosper the
          relationship, dividing time for oneself and for the loved one would be ideal to keep you happy. Meditating together with the partner, or being involved spiritually with the partner is the key to a successful relationship this year.</p>

        <p> This year is an excellent time for Taurus people to focus deep inside and improve since universe is there for your if you focus on expanding your knowledge and skills, this is the year to improve yourself, learn new skills, get ready be prepare for the future, polish yourself so that you can be a shining gold in the coming year, and your hard work and dedication will definitely be fulfilled. One key thing is patience, since Saturn is sitting on your position of luck, you might feel like you are not getting what you deserve but remember Saturn is all about patience, hard work, and not losing hope at any point in time, Saturn is your strict teacher and loves to throw a lot of tests in life but the main goal of the universe if to polish and shine you so that you get out of the karmic cycle and live eternally with blissfulness. There might be a chance of moving to a foreign land for higher studies, people with IT background can do well this year in terms of studies.</p>

        <h2>Gemini Horoscope 2021</h2>

        <p>For Gemini people, Jupiter will be on your 8th house for half of the year and will be on your 9th house for the rest of the year. Saturn will be on your 8th house for the entire year, Rahu will be on your 12th house and Ketu will be on your 6th house.</p>

        <p>This year the major concentration of your life would be on transformation, work, foreign land, and spirituality.</p>

        <p>The year 2021 will bring a lot of changes in Gemini's life, there might be a change of house or even a change of country, there might be a desire to change the workplace and start a new job. With Rahu in the 12th house in the sign of Taurus, where it is in a confused state, Gemini people might get a false sense of enlightenment. Since Rahu is illusionary and is situated in a material sign of Taurus in the 12th house of deep spirituality, Gemini people might have an illusion of enlightenment, therefore the thing to remember is to keep on working on keeping yourself aligned with the universe without any expectation from it, and this path will definitely keep u away from dissatisfaction and negativity, the expectation is the reason for unhappiness, so just work to keep yourself aligned with the universe, and the universe will take care of the rest. </p>

        <p>With major planets being placed on the spiritual and transformations house, Gemini's will have increased interest in metaphysical things, an increase in spirituality is seen, even interest in astrology grows in the year 2021. If your work involves digging deep into any subject matter this placement will help you achieve what you desire. With the major concentration of planets being placed on 8 and 12th house, people with unorthodox ideas or unique ideas might get well appreciated for their ideas if you have a good astakavarga point on Aquarius for Jupiter since Jupiter will be moving to your 9th house in Early April and late November your unique ideas, if implemented, might reap good fruit. Keep thinking out of the box, and open your mind to various ideas and work on your ideas, and success is right there waiting for you. This is the time period for Gemini to dig deep and find what you were always looking for. With Saturn's energy to dig deep with patience into the unknown reason of 8th house and unique ideas boosted by Rahu's aspect from 12th house and Jupiter providing optimism, Gemini's people is bound to success if they somehow implement their learned ideas during
          this time. So keep working hard and dig deep, and you get what your soul always desires. Meditation always helps in opening up our mind and digging deep, so please do use this awesome tool provided by the universe. </p>

        <p>This year the major concentration of your life would be on marriage, partnership, social network, gains, investment, business, and children.</p>

        <p>Saturn is about patience, dedication, routine work, discipline, and Jupiter is about expansion, higher wisdom, and true teachings in life, when these two planets are together there is a creation of magic, you get an opportunity to truly discover and learn the area of the life that these planets are situated, with this combination there might be a deeper connection between you and your partner if you guys were truly committed with each other, or it can break your partnership if you guys were not committed with each other since the combination of these planet helps you see the reality, a foreign person can break your relationship if you guys are not committed with each other. This combination can expand your business to the next level if you previously had worked hard since Jupiter can expand materialism in Capricorn with Saturns help, and since Rahu is aspecting it and is situated in the 11th house it's a good time to invest in your business idea or work harder for your business, since success is sure to come to hard work, dedication, disciple and optimism provided from Saturn and Jupiter combination in 7th house. </p>

        <p>With Rahu in 11th house, it's a wonderful time for cancer people, gains might come from an unexpected source, if you had invested money in a foreign country, or if you are working for a foreign company, the gain is seen. Rahu is exotic and loves meeting foreign people or people who are culturally different from you, so this is the time to explore various places and to meet new people, networking with foreign people might even open up new ideas for business or might help you to prosper financially. Import, export business or IT related business with a foreign connection can blossom this year, so keep working hard with an open mind, and gain is there waiting for you this year.

        <p>Jupiter who is the true teacher of wisdom, who removes the illusion and guides you in the right direction, is together with the strict teacher who loves to give multiple tests, with the goal to bring out good in you, and polish you so that you can deal with what is coming next in your life. When these two different types of teachers are together in the practical sign of Capricorn, it tends to show you the reality of where this combination occurs. Since this combination is in the 6th house of work, enemies, and diseases, this transit will bless you with the ability to know your true enemies, find out people who have created obstacles at your work, and outperform them to move forward. You might also be blessed with the medical treatment if you had any unknown diseases that were bothering you for a long time, Saturn normally does good in the 6th house, and in the sign of Capricorn it is very comfortable, so this transit can help diagnose any hidden diseases that were bothering you. Keep having faith in the universe and seek help, and there is a high probability of your wish being answered with Jupiter aspect to 12th house, Jupiter is creating a tunnel to the universe
          whether so that your prayer can be heard easily if you have a true intention and you are not selfish and is thinking good for all you wish definitely will be fulfilled. </p>

        <p>This year your desire to get recognization, and appreciation from people increases since, the shadow planet resides on your 10th house of status.

        <p>Jupiter is the planet of wisdom, it's the planet that shows you the real path in life and removes illusion, Saturn is also a teacher who shows you the real path in life but with some strict lesson so that you are all prepared for the upcoming days. Saturn makes sure you are polished and are ready to tackle the future, in the parts that it is involved in. In other words, Saturn will show you the reality of the 5th house but in a strict and disciplined manner. With the combination of two wisdom givers in your 5th house the house of romance, love, creativity, speculative business, children, etc, and aspecting 11th house of gains and social network. This combination of two teachers will show you the reality of the 5th house. I will repeat myself 5th house is about fun, romance, speculative business, children, creativity, etc. Therefore this year you will know what you are truly looking for in your partner, you will understand what you want to do in your life with more clarity, and you will understand what makes you happy. If you have a good astakavarga point of Jupiter and Saturn in the 5th house in the sign of Capricorn there is even a chance of childbirth. If you do not
          know how to find your astakavarga point write to me in a comment section, and I can help you with that. </p>

        <p>With Rahu being in the 9th house in the sign of Taurus, there is a high chance of going to the foreign land for higher studies, esp in the field of information technology. Life is all about balance, therefore, do not forget having a good time for yourself and do not overwork, have a short journey and enjoy your life while you are with your family, having a good time for yourself and meditating will definitely remove ambiguity from you and will lead you to the right direction. </p>

        <p>Have a wonderful 2021, my Virgo friends, take care.</p>
        <h2>Libra</h2>

        <p>For libra people, the major concentration of life in the year 2021 will be on your family, savings, research, real estate, etc. </p>

        <p>For Libra people, Jupiter will be on your 4th house for half of the year and will be on your 5th house for the rest of the year. Saturn will be in your 4th house for the entire year, Rahu will be in your 8th house and Ketu will be in your 3rd house. </p>

        <p>So whenever there is a combination of two teachers I mean when two planets the Jupiter and Saturn are together it creates magic. Jupiter is a planet of wisdom it's the true teacher it shows you the real path in life it shows you the reality and Saturn similarly is a teacher as well but Saturn is a strict teacher who loves to give various tests so that you are polished and are really prepared for the future to tackle any difficulties. When these two planets combine together it shows you the reality of that particular house so in the year 2021 the Jupiter and Saturn will be on your fourth house for almost half of the year, so this conjunction will help you realize the reality about 4th house-related stuff which are real state, conveyance, mother, vehicles, etc. With this combination, you will get to know if your relationship with the mother is going well as expected, or if there is anything more that is needed on your side to improve the relationship, you will know whether it is the right time to buy a new house or add a new property, whether selling you home is the right thing to do or not, so the ambiguity about 4th house-related stuff will be clear on the year 2021.</p>

        <p>Apart from that, there is a high chance of random gain if you have invested money outside your home country, or if you are working for some foreign countries. Interest in occult and metaphysical stuff grows this year, so this would be an excellent time for starting meditation if you have not done so yet. So Libra people have a wonderful year ahead and take care. </p>
